**Why We Built BIBROF AI?**
1. Privacy First - Processing happens locally on your device, None of the images are uploaded to server.
2. Faster Processing - Because BIBROF AI runs locally, you skip slow uploads and queues, getting faster results even on large batches.
3. No Credits Needed - Most of the softwares require credits to remove background from images and the free tire is very limited. BIBROF AI doesn't require users to buy credits, Users can save a lot of money.
4. No GPU Needed - We optimized BIBROF AI to run just on CPU so that individuals, creators and startups with lower budget who can not afford GPU based systems too can use our software smoothly.
5. Accuracy and Quality - Most of the softwares charge extra to download the image you uploaded in HD, But BIBROF AI always saves the image in best quality.
6. 100 Images In One Click - Batch processing helps you save time and effort. You can do other things while BIBROF AI is removing background from images for you.

When installing BIBROF AI, Windows may show a blue SmartScreen warning "Windows protected your PC".
This is normal for newly released desktop applications and does not mean the file is unsafe.

**BIBROF AI is 100% safe to download and install from our official website (https://bibrof.lislip.com) and marketplaces (https://whop.com/lislip or https://lislip.gumroad.com)**

Why You See This:
- The app is newly published.
- Windows has not built enough reputation for the executable yet.
- SmartScreen blocks new apps by default.

Follow these quick steps to Bypass the SmartScreen message:
--------------------------------------

1. Run the BIBROF_AI_25.11.03_Setup.exe file.
2. When the SmartScreen window appears, click "More info".
3. Click "Run anyway".
4. The installer will start normally.

This process simply tells Windows that you trust the app.
