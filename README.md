BIBROF AI – How to Fix the Windows SmartScreen Message
--------------------------------------

When installing BIBROF AI, Windows may show a blue SmartScreen warning "Windows protected your PC".
This is normal for newly released desktop applications and does not mean the file is unsafe.

BIBROF AI is 100% safe to download and install from our official website (https://bibrof.lislip.com) and marketplaces (https://whop.com/lislip or https://lislip.gumroad.com)

Why You See This:
- The app is newly published.
- Windows has not built enough reputation for the executable yet.
- SmartScreen blocks new apps by default.

Follow these quick steps to Bypass the SmartScreen message:
--------------------------------------

1. Run the BIBROF_AI_25.11.03_Setup.exe file.
2. When the SmartScreen window appears, click "More info".
3. Click "Run anyway".
4. The installer will start normally.

This process simply tells Windows that you trust the app.
